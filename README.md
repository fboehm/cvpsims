The goal of cvpsims is to improve quality control for the R code used in CV+ analyses.
I'm writing R functions - and unit tests for them - to simplify the code that I use in 
my CV+ analyses. I'm also writing a vignette that explains how to use the functions.
Tidyverse developers have a tutorial on how program with dplyr: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html.
